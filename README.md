# CreatiVision Controller interface

The CreatiVision was a colour TV Gaming Console and Personal Computer from the early 1980's.  It was based on the popular 8-bit 6502 CPU, the TMS9929 Video Display Processor, and the SN76489 Digital Complex Sound Generator chip.

As part of my 8-bit retro computing Minimalist Europe Card Bus (MECB) project, I configured some of the MECB Cards to enable re-Creation of the CreatiVision system hardware.

This just left the need for a Controller Interface, to enable connecting a Keyboard and Joysticks to control my CreatiVision re-Creation.

In addition, during this project I also finally got my hands on an original CreatiVision Console.

The CreatiVision Console uses a relatively complex interface for it's Controllers.  This includes double-pole switches for it's 48-key QWERTY keyboard, making it a relatively non-trivial exercise trying to replace or upgrade a console's existing controllers.  

Unfortunately, due to this complex interface, when the original controllers wear-out or otherwise stop working, another CreatiVision Console might just end up in landfill.  Argh!

In addition, there are also those retro enthusiasts who would like to upgrade their existing CreatiVision Console controllers, to allow using a more modern Keyboard and Joysticks.

So, my CreatiVision Controller interface project turned into a dual purpose design!

It supports upgrading (replacing), the existing controllers on an original CreatiVision Console.  As well as providing support for interfacing directly to a PIA on any CreatiVision re-Creation (like my MECB based re-Creation).

For more information about this project, including the MECB based CreatiVision re-Creation, my design journey creating this CreatiVision Controller interface, and a demonstration of it's use on both an original CreatiVision Console and my MECB CreatiVision re-Creation, be sure to watch my CreatiVision re-Creation series of Videos.

This project is available as either the PCB only, or with optional Packs (to make a Kitset), from my [Tindie Store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/digicoolthings/).
